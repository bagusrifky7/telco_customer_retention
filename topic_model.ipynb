    "BERTopic has several steps in its process. First, for the embedding process, for this model training, we will use the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 pre trained model because is one of the lightest pre-trained embedding models for Natural Language Processing. How this embedding model works by applying cosine similarity to get semantic relationships between tokens by pairing between two sentence to get true pairs and false pairs.  This all-MiniLM-L6-v2 embedding model is based on MiniLM-L6-H384-uncased. The second process is clustering to create a cluster for each topic. The last process is the tokenizer and weighted scheme to understand deeper context between tokens."
